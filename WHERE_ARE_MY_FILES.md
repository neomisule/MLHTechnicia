# 📁 How to Get Your Project Files

## The files are ready! Here's how to access them:

### Step 1: Where Are the Files?

The complete project folder is located at:
**voice-clone-app**

It contains:
```
voice-clone-app/
├── backend/          ← Python server files
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── .env.example
├── frontend/         ← React app files
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.jsx
│   │   ├── App.css
│   │   └── main.jsx
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── package.json
│   └── vite.config.js
├── README.md
├── QUICKSTART.md
└── other documentation files
```

### Step 2: What to Do in VS Code

Since you're using VS Code, here's what to do:

1. **Find where you downloaded the folder**
   - Check your Downloads folder
   - Or check Desktop
   - Look for a folder called "voice-clone-app"

2. **Open VS Code**

3. **Open the folder**
   - Click: File → Open Folder
   - Navigate to "voice-clone-app" folder
   - Click "Select Folder" or "Open"

4. **You should now see:**
   - On the left sidebar (Explorer)
   - A folder tree with "backend" and "frontend"

### Step 3: If You Still Don't See the Folders

The files might not have downloaded properly. Here are your options:

#### Option A: Tell me and I'll create them again
Just say "I need the files recreated" and I'll make them fresh for you.

#### Option B: Create the folders manually in VS Code
I can give you the exact code to paste into each file.

#### Option C: Use a different method
I can create a single ZIP file or guide you differently.
